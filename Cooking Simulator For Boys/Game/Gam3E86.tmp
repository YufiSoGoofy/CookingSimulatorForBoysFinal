A levelling system used to display the player’s current level in the game. 
A money counter to display money earned with each order.
A timer is used for simulating how fast the player needs to cook in a real life setting like in a restaurant with hundreds of customers that actively want their meal to be finished cooking.
A pause menu that allows the player to pause their game to change any additional settings like adjusting the window mode, turning up or down the volume of the music or even being able to view the instructions of the game.

Finishing dishes as quickly as possible also helps you gain money and experience points to level up. (EXP)
The more you level up the more money you can get.
